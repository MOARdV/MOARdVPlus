# MOARdVPlus

Advanced IVA designs for Kerbal Space Program, powered by MOARdV's Avionics Systems

## What is this?

MOARdV's [Avionics Systems](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems) is a complex plugin, with well over 800 functions plus
scripting available for the adventurous IVA creator.  Generic IVAs for the mod do not really showcase what MAS
is capable of doing.  Some of the features in MAS are directed towards bespoke control systems instead of the generic MFDs and switches
that have been the norm for both RasterPropMonitor and MAS during its development.  However, advanced IVA control systems have a much
steeper learning curve, and it would be incredibly rude to include hard-to-understand designs in the basic MAS distribution.  I
want people to *enjoy* playing in IVA, not for them to be discouraged by complicated designs.

So here is MOARdV Plus (dV++ +), a collection of IVA designs that can make an otherwise-vanilla KSP installation feel
like a whole different game.

## What's here?

**COMING SOON!**

The MAS FASA RA-01 CM, a [Bluedog Design Bureau](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122020-14x-bluedog-design-bureau-stockalike-saturn-apollo-and-more-v142-i-numbered-this-update-before-ksp-updated-1feb2018/)-compatible Apollo command module derived from the FASA Apollo CM.  This version of the CM uses Apollo-era controls for almost all of the IVA.

**FUTURE UPDATES**

When they're far enough along to mention, I'll mention them.  I am planning on a glass cockpit next.

## Required Mods

Without these mods, MOARdVPlus will not work.  Please ensure you have installed current versions of each of these mods.

* MOARdV's [Avionics Systems](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems): This is what makes the IVA do something other than look fancy.
* [ASET Props Pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116430-aset-props-pack-v14-for-the-modders-who-create-iva/): This is one of the dependencies for MAS.  Without these incredible props, MAS would be very boring.  ASET Props are the creation of alexustas.
* [ASET Avionics Pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116479-aset-avionics-pack-v-20-for-the-modders-who-create-iva/): This is one of the dependencies for MAS.  ASET Avionics is a collection of aircraft-centric components.  Without these incredible props, MAS would be very boring.  ASET Avionics are the creation of alexustas.
* [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-130-module-manager-281-june-29th-2017-with-n-cats-physics/): This is also a MAS dependency.  Without MM, MAS would not be able to update existing IVAs.

For individual IVAs:

* [Bluedog Design Bureau](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122020-14x-bluedog-design-bureau-stockalike-saturn-apollo-and-more-v142-i-numbered-this-update-before-ksp-updated-1feb2018/): MAS FASA Apollo CMs are designed specifically to work with the BDB Kane service modules and docking ports and the Sarnus launch stack.
You may use the Apollo CM separately, but not all of the functionality built into the IVA will work with other Apollo / Saturn mods.

## Optional Mods

These mods enhance the MOARdVPlus IVA experience.  However, if your game installation doesn't use these mods, you can still fly with
MOARdVPlus IVAs.

* [Chatterer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83290-15x-chatterer-v0996-just-keep-talking-to-me-18-oct-2018/): Otherwise in space, no one can hear you ... talk.
* [MechJeb](forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154834-15x-anatid-robotics-mumech-mechjeb-autopilot-281-16-october-2018/): Real World (TM) space ships don't go to space using a keyboard, mouse, or a controller as the primary control input.  Why should you?

## How do I use this?

MOARdVPlus IVAs are not for the faint of heart.  They include custom controls intended specifically for a particular set of mods,
or a particular configuration of parts.  Unlike the IVAs included in MAS (and previously RasterPropMonitor), these IVAs do not try
to be generic enough for every possible use.

Read the manual.

Seriously, look on the [wiki](https://github.com/MOARdV/MOARdVPlus/wiki) for a manual that describes the crew stations aboard the command modules, and the CM's intended applications.
